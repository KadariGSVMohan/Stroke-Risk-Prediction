# 🧠 Stroke Risk Prediction App

A **Streamlit-powered web application** that predicts the risk of stroke using machine learning. Users can input key medical parameters and receive real-time stroke risk assessments along with a downloadable PDF health report.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Stroke Risk Prediction** using a trained ML model (Logistic Regression)
- 📊 **Interactive Streamlit UI** for user input
- 📄 **Downloadable PDF Health Report**
- ℹ️ **Informative Tabs** for app usage and dataset understanding
- 💡 Built for awareness and early risk screening

## 🧬 Input Features

The app uses the following health indicators:
- Age
- Gender
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Marital Status
- Work Type
- Residence Type
- Average Glucose Level
- BMI
- Smoking Status

## 🗂 Dataset

This app uses the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains health records of individuals along with a binary target indicating the occurrence of stroke.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
